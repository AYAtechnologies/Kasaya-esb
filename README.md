==========
## Status
At the moment library is unstable 

## Requirements
### fast
 - lightweight
 - easy to implement and to expose written code (no more than writing a 10 line worker class)
 - linear scalability
	
### distributed
 - No global database
 - No configuration change needed to add workers (all workers should have common configuration)
 - any number of workers serving the same service should be possible
 - distributed global configuration and broadcasting
 - no single point of failure

### service-oriented
 - service discovery
 - each feature of the system should be able to be run on any worker
 - workers would serve "system" services and "application" services

### layered architecture
 - each message would be processed by layered "application" services eg. authorization

### persistent
 - failure of a single worker should not stop the system 
 (it may stop providing the service )
 - failure of data stored by a configurable amount of workers should not cause any data loss in the system
 - persistence based on key-value stores held on each worker
	
### all synchronization support
 - synchronous 
 - asynchronous with no response (task)
 - asynchronous with polling

### Good exception propagation
### independent 
 - limited requirements (ZMQ, )
 - no persistance dependency any key-value store should be enough to run (first implementation dependend on Riak)
